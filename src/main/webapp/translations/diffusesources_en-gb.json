Each year, the Convention&rsquo;s <a href='http://www.ceip.at/' >EMEP Centre on Emission Inventories and Projections (CEIP)</a> prepares gridded emission maps for certain pollutants and sectors. Specific EMEP/CEIP maps have been re-projected for use in this website.</p><p>When producing these maps, EMEP/CEIP firstly converts the detailed annual emissions data from countries into 11 aggregated sector groups. Where data is not available from countries or is considered inconsistent, EMEP/CEIP also performs a gap-filling process to improve the data quality. Emissions for recent years, such as 2007, are then spatially disaggregated on the basis of gridded data sets reported for the reference year 2005 using the EMEP &lsquo;Grid Scaler&rsquo;.</p><p>A technical overview of the gridding process performed by EMEP/CEIP is available <a href='http://www.ceip.at/fileadmin/inhalte/emep/pdf/gridding_process.pdf' >here</a>.
