		"PollutantPageContentEPER": "<h1>EPER Pollutants&nbsp;</h1><p>The <em>European Pollutant Emission Register </em>(EPER) was the first European-wide register of industrial emissions into air and water, which was established by a <a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:192:0036:0043:EN:PDF' ><span style='color: #003399;'>Commission Decision of 17 July 2000</span> </a>(EPER Decision).</p><p>Under EPER, Member States reported <em>data for the years 2001 and 2004</em>. This information is accessible through the E-PRTR website following the merging of the EPER and E-PRTR databases. EPER and E-PRTR are very similar but there are some differences. As a result, and in order to grant full access to the EPER Data as originally reported by Member States, the 'EPER search' menu item works using the EPER Activity list and the EPER naming of substances and groups.</p><p>The EPER substances were determined by <a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:192:0036:0043:EN:PDF#page=3' >Annex A1 of the EPER Decision</a>.</p><p>E-PRTR contains all the substances listed in the EPER Decision as well as some additional ones. <em>While </em><em>EPER had 50 substances the E-PRTR contains 91</em>. Furthermore, some substances are not listed in the same way or have been reported according to different rules in the E-PRTR system. The main differences are:</p><ul><li>For <em>CO2 emissions<span style='color: #000000;'>,</SPAN></em>EPER excluded emissions of CO2 from biomass whilst the E-PRTR figure includes all sources of emissions. However, some facilities report an additional figure, on a voluntary basis, of the CO2 emitted excluded biomass sources. </li><li>The <em>BTEX group</em> was reported according to a different criterion. In EPER only benzene was reported individually alongside with a figure for the whole group (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl-benzene and Xylene). In the E-PRTR information for each individual pollutant is reported separately. This means that no time series will be available for Benzene (release to water), Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene between the EPER and the E-PRTR dataset. However, when displaying the time series on facility level for BTEX, it is possible to present the aggregation of the four pollutants for the E-PRTR reporting years as well.</li><li>The <em>PAHs group</em> was also reported differently since the E-PRTR determines which specific substances have to be reported and this might differ to what was reported to EPER (which did not determine the individual substances to be considered within the group). </li><li>Some reporting <em>thresholds are slightly different </em>between the two systems. </li></ul><p><a href='docs/EPER Pollutants PDF.pdf ' >A full list of EPER substances is available here.</a></p>",

E-PRTR covers data reported by many countries and collected from a wide range of sectors of activity and more than 28 000 individual sources of data.
