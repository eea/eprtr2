The respective authorities in the countries compile and check the quality of the reported data. The data are then provided to the European Commission and the European Environment Agency for compilation and dissemination on this E-PRTR website.

For the informal review of E-PRTR data from 2007, 2008 and 2009 three of its European topic centres have been involved.</p><p>In a <em>first step</em>, detailed feedback was provided to countries concerning the quality of the E-PRTR data. The checks covered an evaluation of the number of facilities and release reports, amounts of releases and transfers reported, confidentiality claims, accidental releases, etc.</p><p>As <em>second step</em>, the E-PRTR data were put into context with data reported under the Convention of Long Range Transboundary Air pollution, United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change and EU Emission Trading Scheme (for releases to Air), with data reported to Eurostat and EEA (for waste data and transboundary movement of waste), with data reported to EEA and to the Water Information System of Europe WISE (for release to Water). The aims is <em>to highlight differences and potential inconsistencies </em>between data reported under different reporting obligations on the basis of which reporting countries can correct their deliveries whereas errors are found.</p><p>A more formal exercise is carried out in 2011, with a full data review in accordance with Article 17 of the E-PRTR Regulation.</p><p>In case errors are found after the data submission, reporting countries will have the possibility to correct the data reported.

Parties to the Protocol can set stricter conditions for the establishment and functioning of their PRTR systems while working towards convergence between these systems.</p><p>The EC Regulation goes beyond the PRTR Protocol by requiring the reporting on 5 additional pollutants (Octylphenols and Octylphenol ethoxylates, Fluoranthene, Isodrin, Hexabromobiphenyl, Benzo(g,h,i)perylene) and imposing more stringent thresholds for another 6 pollutants; PCDD (dioxins), PCDF (furans), tetrachloroethylene, tetrachloromethane, trichlorobenzene, trichloroethylene and trichloromethane.</p><p>There are some other differences:</p><ul><li>The thresholds for off-site transfers of waste water defined in the E-PRTR Regulation are for a large number of pollutants more stringent compared to the thresholds in the PRTR Protocol. </li><li>The Protocol includes two different approaches to define the facility scope; capacity thresholds or employee thresholds. In the E-PRTR Regulation the capacity threshold approach was chosen. </li><li>For waste transfers, the Protocol provides for two different approaches to define the threshold above which waste transfers have to be reported; total amounts of waste transferred or total amounts of a specific pollutant transferred in the waste.  In E-PRTR the mass based approach (threshold based on the total amount of waste transferred) has been chosen. </li></ul><p>According to this Regulation, the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency, must make the European PRTR publicly accessible by dissemination free of charge on the Internet. This is the purpose of this E-PRTR web-site.</p>"},{"Order": 10, "Title": "How has the quality of E-PRTR data been checked?","Content": "<p>Operators subject to the E-PRTR Regulation are required to provide competent authorities with the best available data on their facilities' pollutant releases and transfers.</p><p>It lies within the remit of the national competent authorities assess the quality of the data and whether the information provided by the individual facilities is satisfactory with respect to its completeness, consistency and accuracy.  For additional explanation on the quality control and assurance processes in each EU Member State, please see the <a href='docs/EN_E-PRTR_fin.pdf '>E-PRTR guidance document </a>and the links to the existing <a href='pgLinksNationalRegisters.aspx'>national registers.</a></p><p>Member States, the Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA) have checked that the data submitted comply with the agreed reporting format through different automatic validation processes. The validation covers key information such as the type of pollutants, the codes for industrial sectors, the geographical coordinates and the format of the data. Such a validation is required before data can be included in the E-PRTR register.</p><p>The datasets are assessed and reviewed including comparison with data reported under the previous register EPER as well as a geographical check.</p>"},{"Order": 11, "Title": "How do I know whether the reported releases are dangerous?","Content": "<p>A summary description of the 91 E-PRTR pollutants is <a href='http://prtr.ec.europa.eu/pgLibraryPollutants.aspx'>provided here.</a></p><p>&nbsp;This information does not, however, indicate the risk to human health or the environment from the emission releases levels in a specific area at a specific point in time.</p><p>In accordance with European and national legislation, facilities covered by E-PRTR can only operate if they have been issued the appropriate permits which set out the conditions established by the competent authorities to protect human health and the environment. E-PRTR does not assess facilities' compliance with these permitting conditions. Exceedance of the E-PRTR annual emission threshold values does not mean that the facilities are not compliant with their permit conditions. Requests for information on compliance issues should be addressed to the Member States' competent authorities.</p>"},{"Order": 12, "Title": "Is any information kept confidential?","Content": "<p>All PRTR data reported by operators appears on the website except the data claimed as confidential by the Member State.</p><p>Whenever information is kept confidential by a Member State in accordance with Article 4 of <a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:041:0026:0032:EN:PDF'>Directive 2003/4/EC</a> on public access to environmental information, the Member State has to indicate separately for each data that has been withheld, the reason for which it has been withheld.</p>"},{"Order": 13, "Title": "Which facilities are shown on the maps?","Content": "<p>All facilities have to report their geographical co-ordinates, which are shown on the maps.

For more information on the IPPC Directive, see the Commission <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pollutants/stationary/ippc/summary.htm'>IPPC web-site</a> and the <a href='http://iris.eionet.europa.eu/'>IRIS</a> (Industrial emissions Reporting Information System) web-site.</p><p>However, some E-PRTR activities are partially or not covered by the IPPC Directive, for instance the activities mentioned below (the code used referred to the number used in Annex I of the E-PRTR Regulation):</p><ul><li>1(e) Coal rolling mills;</li><li>1(f) Installations for the manufacture of coal products and solid smokeless fuel;</li><li>3(a) Underground mining and related operations;</li><li>3(b) Opencast mining and quarrying;</li><li>5(f) Urban waste-water treatment plants;</li><li>5(g) Independently operated industrial waste-water treatment plants;</li><li>6(b) Industrial plants for the production of paper, board and other primary wood products (such as chipboard, fibreboard and plywood);</li><li>6(c) Industrial plants for the preservation of wood and wood products with chemicals;</li><li>7(b) Intensive aquaculture;</li><li>9(e) Installations for the building of, and painting or removal of paint from ships.</li></ul><p>A full comparison between IPPC activites and E-PRTR activities is available in Appendix 2 of the E-PRTR <a href='docs/EN_E-PRTR_fin.pdf '>Guidance document</a>.</p>"},{"Order": 16, "Title": "What are the interactions between the E-PRTR register and the Emission Trading Scheme Directive?","Content": "<p>Most activities falling under the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme Directive (Directive <a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:140:0063:0087:en:PDF'>2009/29/EC</a>) are subject to the E-PRTR Regulation. Notable exceptions are combustion of fuels in installation with a total rated thermal input between 20 and 50 MW. In addition, some of the ETS activities descriptions slightly differ from the E-PRTR activities.</p><p>Please also note that under E-PRTR there is a facility-based reporting and under EU ETS an installation-based reporting which makes the data not directly comparable.</p><p>For more information on the ETS Directive, see the Commission&rsquo;s <a
